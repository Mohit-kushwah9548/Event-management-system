# Event-management-system
# GLAU EVENT — Event Management System

This is a lightweight event management platform (frontend + backend) for demo and local development. It supports browsing events, client registration/login, ticket booking with a simulated payment flow, PDF ticket generation, and an admin dashboard for managing events and clients.

Repository link
- Original upstream / related repo: https://github.com/Mohit-kushwah9548/Event-management-system

Project structure (important files)
- `backend/` — Express.js API and server code
  - `src/config/localdb.js` — development JSON-backed storage (used when MongoDB/Atlas is not available)
  - `src/controllers/` — API controllers for auth, events, orders
  - `server.js` / `app.js` — Express server entry
- `frontend/index.html` — single-file vanilla JS SPA (UI, admin, booking flow, PDF generation)
- `uploads/` — (optional) static uploads folder

Features
- Browse events, view event details
- Client register / login and dashboard
- Ticket booking with simulated payment (card form) and purchase records
- PDF ticket generation (uses `html2pdf` as a client-side library) and print fallback
- Admin dashboard: events management (add/edit/delete), clients view, basic analytics

Quick setup (Windows / PowerShell)
1. Install dependencies for backend:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Asus\GLAU-EVENT\backend
npm install
```

2. Start the backend in development mode (it will use the local JSON DB by default in dev):

```powershell
npm run dev
# or: node server.js
```

3. Open the frontend:
- If the backend serves static files, open: `http://localhost:5000`
- Or open the file directly in your browser:

```text
C:\Users\Asus\GLAU-EVENT\frontend\index.html
```

Demo credentials
- Admin: `admin@glau.com` / `admin123`
- Client: `client@glau.com` / `client123`

Notes & development details
- The project contains a development fallback to JSON files to avoid depending on MongoDB/Atlas or Docker during local testing. Look for `localdb` or `data/` in the backend.
- Admin actions that attempt to sync with the backend will try to call protected endpoints; in development these may be unreachable without proper admin auth. The frontend applies local changes first and attempts a best-effort backend sync.
- PDF ticket generation is client-side (uses `html2pdf` CDN) and includes a print fallback.

Common commands
- Start backend: `npm run dev`
- Run lint/tests (if present): check `backend/package.json` scripts
